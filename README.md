# Garrett Allen

I am the founding AI Engineer at [LayerLens.ai](https://layerlens.ai), where I develop AI model evaluation frameworks. My research interests focus on world models and machine agency, exploring how AI systems develop internal representations to understand and navigate their environment.

Previously, I graduated from the University of Southern California with a degree in Mathematics and competed as a Division I NCAA Men's Water Polo athlete. My work now focuses on advancing model evaluation frameworks, designing robust benchmarking systems, and developing new approaches to assess emerging AI capabilities.
