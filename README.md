# Garrett Allen

I am an AI Engineer at [LayerLens.ai](https://layerlens.ai), where I develop AI model evaluation frameworks. My research interests center on world models and autonomous systems, exploring how AI can build rich internal representations to understand and interact with its environment.

Previously, I graduated from the University of Southern California with a degree in Mathematics and competed as a Division I NCAA Men's Water Polo athlete. Through my work at LayerLens, I focus on advancing interpretability methods and building robust evaluation systems for large language models.
